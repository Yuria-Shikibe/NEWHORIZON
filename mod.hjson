description: "Expanded contents, including Units, Turrets, Blocks, etc.\n\n [accent]This mod adds a new setting dialog when start the game.[] [gray]By choose the available setting, you can activate in-game debug panel and advance load, which creates outline icons and unit full icons automatically. However, the advance load now causes stuck problem when the game is loaded on a phone. So for your gaming experience, I made it defaults false. If you are confident with your device, active it. If you find your device cannot afford it, open the mod file folder and find the 'new-horizon' folder then open the properties file in it, and then rewrite the ''@active.advance-load*' to false, then open the game again."
